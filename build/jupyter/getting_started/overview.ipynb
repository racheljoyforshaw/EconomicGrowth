    "**pandas** is a [Python](https://www.python.org) package providing fast,\n",
    "flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with\n",
    "“relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the\n",
    "fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, **real world** data\n",
    "analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming **the\n",
    "most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool\n",
    "available in any language**. It is already well on its way toward this goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas is well suited for many different kinds of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or\n",
    "  Excel spreadsheet  \n",
    "- Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series data.  \n",
    "- Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and\n",
    "  column labels  \n",
    "- Any other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data actually\n",
    "  need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas data structure  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The two primary data structures of pandas, `Series` (1-dimensional)\n",
    "and `DataFrame` (2-dimensional), handle the vast majority of typical use\n",
    "cases in finance, statistics, social science, and many areas of\n",
    "engineering. For R users, `DataFrame` provides everything that R’s\n",
    "`data.frame` provides and much more. pandas is built on top of [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org) and is intended to integrate well within a scientific\n",
    "computing environment with many other 3rd party libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Easy handling of **missing data** (represented as NaN) in floating point as\n",
    "  well as non-floating point data  \n",
    "- Size mutability: columns can be **inserted and deleted** from DataFrame and\n",
    "  higher dimensional objects  \n",
    "- Automatic and explicit **data alignment**: objects can be explicitly\n",
    "  aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and\n",
    "  let Series, DataFrame, etc. automatically align the data for you in\n",
    "  computations  \n",
    "- Powerful, flexible **group by** functionality to perform\n",
    "  split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating and\n",
    "  transforming data  \n",
    "- Make it **easy to convert** ragged, differently-indexed data in other\n",
    "  Python and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects  \n",
    "- Intelligent label-based **slicing**, **fancy indexing**, and **subsetting**\n",
    "  of large data sets  \n",
    "- Intuitive **merging** and **joining** data sets  \n",
    "- Flexible **reshaping** and pivoting of data sets  \n",
    "- **Hierarchical** labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per\n",
    "  tick)  \n",
    "- Robust IO tools for loading data from **flat files** (CSV and delimited),\n",
    "  Excel files, databases, and saving / loading data from the ultrafast **HDF5\n",
    "  format**  \n",
    "- **Time series**-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency\n",
    "  conversion, moving window statistics, moving window linear regressions,\n",
    "  date shifting and lagging, etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of these principles are here to address the shortcomings frequently\n",
    "experienced using other languages / scientific research environments. For data\n",
    "scientists, working with data is typically divided into multiple stages:\n",
    "munging and cleaning data, analyzing / modeling it, then organizing the results\n",
    "of the analysis into a form suitable for plotting or tabular display. pandas\n",
    "is the ideal tool for all of these tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other notes\n",
    "\n",
    "> - pandas is **fast**. Many of the low-level algorithmic bits have been\n",
    "  extensively tweaked in [Cython](https://cython.org) code. However, as with\n",
    "  anything else generalization usually sacrifices performance. So if you focus\n",
    "  on one feature for your application you may be able to create a faster\n",
    "  specialized tool.  \n",
    "- pandas is a dependency of [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html), making it an important part of the\n",
