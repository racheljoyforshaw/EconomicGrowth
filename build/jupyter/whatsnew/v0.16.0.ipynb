The intent was to provide a user-friendly set of accessors that give the ‘natural’ value for that unit, e.g. if you had a `Timedelta('1 day, 10:11:12')`, then `.seconds` would return 12. However, this is at odds with the definition of `datetime.timedelta`, which defines `.seconds` as `10 * 3600 + 11 * 60 + 12 == 36672`.\n",
