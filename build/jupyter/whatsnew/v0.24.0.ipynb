    "  As a consequence, other uses of the name `labels` in `MultiIndex` have also been deprecated and replaced with `codes`:  \n",
    "  - You should initialize a `MultiIndex` instance using a parameter named `codes` rather than `labels`.  \n",
    "  - `MultiIndex.set_labels` has been deprecated in favor of `MultiIndex.set_codes()`.  \n",
    "  - For method `MultiIndex.copy()`, the `labels` parameter has been deprecated and replaced by a `codes` parameter.  \n",

    "- The signature of `Series.to_csv()` has been uniformed to that of `DataFrame.to_csv()`: the name of the first argument is now `path_or_buf`, the order of subsequent arguments has changed, the `header` argument now defaults to `True`. ([GH19715](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/19715))  \n",

    "- Creating a `TimedeltaIndex`, `DatetimeIndex`, or `PeriodIndex` by passing range arguments start, end, and periods is deprecated in favor of `timedelta_range()`, `date_range()`, or `period_range()` ([GH23919](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/23919))  \n",
    "- Passing a string alias like `'datetime64[ns, UTC]'` as the `unit` parameter to `DatetimeTZDtype` is deprecated. Use `DatetimeTZDtype.construct_from_string` instead ([GH23990](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/23990)).  \n",
    "- The `skipna` parameter of `infer_dtype()` will switch to `True` by default in a future version of pandas ([GH17066](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/17066), [GH24050](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/24050))  \n",
    "- In `Series.where()` with Categorical data, providing an `other` that is not present in the categories is deprecated. Convert the categorical to a different dtype or add the `other` to the categories first ([GH24077](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/24077)).  \n",
    "- `Series.clip_lower()`, `Series.clip_upper()`, `DataFrame.clip_lower()` and `DataFrame.clip_upper()` are deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Use `Series.clip(lower=threshold)`, `Series.clip(upper=threshold)` and the equivalent `DataFrame` methods ([GH24203](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/24203))  \n",

    "- Passing an integer to `Series.fillna()` and `DataFrame.fillna()` with `timedelta64[ns]` dtypes is deprecated, will raise `TypeError` in a future version.  Use `obj.fillna(pd.Timedelta(...))` instead ([GH24694](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/24694))  \n",
