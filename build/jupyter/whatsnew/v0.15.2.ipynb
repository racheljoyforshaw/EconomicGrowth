See [here](user_guide/io.ipynb#io-stata-categorical) for more information on importing categorical variables from Stata data files.  \n",
    "- Added ability to export Categorical data to to/from HDF5 ([GH7621](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/7621)). Queries work the same as if it was an object array. However, the `category` dtyped data is stored in a more efficient manner. See [here](user_guide/io.ipynb#io-hdf5-categorical) for an example and caveats w.r.t. prior versions of pandas.  \n",
