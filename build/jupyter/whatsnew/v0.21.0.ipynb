    "\n",
    "- Integration with [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/), including a new top-level `read_parquet()` function and `DataFrame.to_parquet()` method, see [here](#whatsnew-0210-enhancements-parquet).  \n",

    "  categoricals independent of the data, see [here](#whatsnew-0210-enhancements-categorical-dtype).  \n",
    "- The behavior of `sum` and `prod` on all-NaN Series/DataFrames is now consistent and no longer depends on whether [bottleneck](http://berkeleyanalytics.com/bottleneck) is installed, and `sum` and `prod` on empty Series now return NaN instead of 0, see [here](#whatsnew-0210-api-breaking-bottleneck).  \n",
    "- Compatibility fixes for pypy, see [here](#whatsnew-0210-pypy).  \n",
    "- Additions to the `drop`, `reindex` and `rename` API to make them more consistent, see [here](#whatsnew-0210-enhancements-drop-api).  \n",
    "- Addition of the new methods `DataFrame.infer_objects` (see [here](#whatsnew-0210-enhancements-infer-objects)) and `GroupBy.pipe` (see [here](#whatsnew-0210-enhancements-groupby-pipe)).  \n",
    "- Indexing with a list of labels, where one or more of the labels is missing, is deprecated and will raise a KeyError in a future version, see [here](#whatsnew-0210-api-breaking-loc).  \n",

If a merge is found to not be an example of specified merge type, an exception of type `MergeError` will be raised. For more, see [here](user_guide/merging.ipynb#merging-validation) ([GH16270](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/16270))  \n",

    "- Accessing a non-existent attribute on a closed `HDFStore` will now\n",
    "  raise an `AttributeError` rather than a `ClosedFileError` ([GH16301](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/16301))  \n",
    "- `read_csv()` now issues a `UserWarning` if the `names` parameter contains duplicates ([GH17095](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/17095))  \n",
    "- `read_csv()` now treats `'null'` and `'n/a'` strings as missing values by default ([GH16471](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/16471), [GH16078](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/16078))  \n",
    "- `pandas.HDFStore`’s string representation is now faster and less detailed. For the previous behavior, use `pandas.HDFStore.info()`. ([GH16503](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/16503)).  \n",
    "- Compression defaults in HDF stores now follow pytables standards. Default is no compression and if `complib` is missing and `complevel` > 0 `zlib` is used ([GH15943](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/15943))  \n",
    "- `Index.get_indexer_non_unique()` now returns a ndarray indexer rather than an `Index`; this is consistent with `Index.get_indexer()` ([GH16819](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/16819))  \n",
    "- Removed the `@slow` decorator from `pandas.util.testing`, which caused issues for some downstream packages’ test suites. Use `@pytest.mark.slow` instead, which achieves the same thing ([GH16850](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/16850))  \n",
    "- Moved definition of `MergeError` to the `pandas.errors` module.  \n",
    "- The signature of `Series.set_axis()` and `DataFrame.set_axis()` has been changed from `set_axis(axis, labels)` to `set_axis(labels, axis=0)`, for consistency with the rest of the API. The old signature is deprecated and will show a `FutureWarning` ([GH14636](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/14636))  \n",
    "- `Series.argmin()` and `Series.argmax()` will now raise a `TypeError` when used with `object` dtypes, instead of a `ValueError` ([GH13595](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/13595))  \n",
    "- `Period` is now immutable, and will now raise an `AttributeError` when a user tries to assign a new value to the `ordinal` or `freq` attributes ([GH17116](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/17116)).  \n",
    "- `to_datetime()` when passed a tz-aware `origin=` kwarg will now raise a more informative `ValueError` rather than a `TypeError` ([GH16842](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/16842))  \n",
    "- `to_datetime()` now raises a `ValueError` when format includes `%W` or `%U` without also including day of the week and calendar year ([GH16774](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/16774))  \n",
    "- Renamed non-functional `index` to `index_col` in `read_stata()` to improve API consistency ([GH16342](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/16342))  \n",
    "- Bug in `DataFrame.drop()` caused boolean labels `False` and `True` to be treated as labels 0 and 1 respectively when dropping indices from a numeric index. This will now raise a ValueError ([GH16877](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/16877))  \n",
    "- Restricted DateOffset keyword arguments.  Previously, `DateOffset` subclasses allowed arbitrary keyword arguments which could lead to unexpected behavior.  Now, only valid arguments will be accepted. ([GH17176](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/17176)).  \n",

    "- Using `DataFrame.rename_axis()` and `Series.rename_axis()` to alter index or column *labels* is now deprecated in favor of using `.rename`. `rename_axis` may still be used to alter the name of the index or columns ([GH17833](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/17833)).  \n",
