    "## Fixed regressions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fixed regression in `DataFrame.all()` and `DataFrame.any()` where `bool_only=True` was ignored ([GH25101](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/25101))  \n",
    "- Fixed issue in `DataFrame` construction with passing a mixed list of mixed types could segfault. ([GH25075](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/25075))  \n",
    "- Fixed regression in `DataFrame.apply()` causing `RecursionError` when `dict`-like classes were passed as argument. ([GH25196](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/25196))  \n",
    "- Fixed regression in `DataFrame.replace()` where `regex=True` was only replacing patterns matching the start of the string ([GH25259](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/25259))  \n",
    "- Fixed regression in `DataFrame.duplicated()`, where empty dataframe was not returning a boolean dtyped Series. ([GH25184](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/25184))  \n",
    "- Fixed regression in `Series.min()` and `Series.max()` where `numeric_only=True` was ignored when the `Series` contained `Categorical` data ([GH25299](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/25299))  \n",
    "- Fixed regression in subtraction between `Series` objects with `datetime64[ns]` dtype incorrectly raising `OverflowError` when the `Series` on the right contains null values ([GH25317](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/25317))  \n",
    "- Fixed regression in `TimedeltaIndex` where `np.sum(index)` incorrectly returned a zero-dimensional object instead of a scalar ([GH25282](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/25282))  \n",
    "- Fixed regression in `IntervalDtype` construction where passing an incorrect string with ‘Interval’ as a prefix could result in a `RecursionError`. ([GH25338](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/25338))  \n",
    "- Fixed regression in creating a period-dtype array from a read-only NumPy array of period objects. ([GH25403](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/25403))  \n",
    "- Fixed regression in `Categorical`, where constructing it from a categorical `Series` and an explicit `categories=` that differed from that in the `Series` created an invalid object which could trigger segfaults. ([GH25318](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/25318))  \n",
    "- Fixed regression in `to_timedelta()` losing precision when converting floating data to `Timedelta` data ([GH25077](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/25077)).  \n",
    "- Fixed pip installing from source into an environment without NumPy ([GH25193](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/25193))  \n",
    "- Fixed regression in `DataFrame.replace()` where large strings of numbers would be coerced into `int64`, causing an `OverflowError` ([GH25616](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/25616))  \n",
    "- Fixed regression in `factorize()` when passing a custom `na_sentinel` value with `sort=True` ([GH25409](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/25409)).  \n",
    "- Fixed regression in `DataFrame.to_csv()` writing duplicate line endings with gzip compress ([GH25311](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/25311))  \n",

    "- Better handling of terminal printing when the terminal dimensions are not known ([GH25080](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/25080))  \n",
    "- Bug in reading a HDF5 table-format `DataFrame` created in Python 2, in Python 3 ([GH24925](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/24925))  \n",
    "- Bug in reading a JSON with `orient='table'` generated by `DataFrame.to_json()` with `index=False` ([GH25170](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/25170))  \n",
    "- Bug where float indexes could have misaligned values when printing ([GH25061](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/25061))  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Categorical**\n",

    "- - \n",
    "\n",
    "**Reshaping**\n",

    "- Bug in `transform()` where applying a function to a timezone aware column would return a timezone naive result ([GH24198](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/24198))  \n",
    "- Bug in `DataFrame.join()` when joining on a timezone aware `DatetimeIndex` ([GH23931](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/23931))  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualization**\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other**\n",

    "- Bug in `Series.is_unique()` where single occurrences of `NaN` were not considered unique ([GH25180](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/25180))  \n",
    "- Bug in `merge()` when merging an empty `DataFrame` with an `Int64` column or a non-empty `DataFrame` with an `Int64` column that is all `NaN` ([GH25183](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/25183))  \n",
    "- Bug in `IntervalTree` where a `RecursionError` occurs upon construction due to an overflow when adding endpoints, which also causes `IntervalIndex` to crash during indexing operations ([GH25485](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/25485))  \n",
    "- Bug in `Series.size` raising for some extension-array-backed `Series`, rather than returning the size ([GH25580](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/25580))  \n",
    "- Bug in resampling raising for nullable integer-dtype columns ([GH25580](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/25580))  \n",
