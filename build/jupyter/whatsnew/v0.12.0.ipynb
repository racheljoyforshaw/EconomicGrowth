    "  `np.nan` or `np.inf` as appropriate ([GH3590](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/3590)). This correct a numpy bug that treats `integer`\n",
    "  and `float` dtypes differently.  \n",
    "- Add `squeeze` keyword to `groupby` to allow reduction from\n",
    "  DataFrame -> Series if groups are unique. This is a Regression from 0.10.1.\n",

    "  and thus you should cast to an appropriate numeric dtype if you need to\n",
    "  plot something.  \n",
    "- Add `colormap` keyword to DataFrame plotting methods. Accepts either a\n",
    "  matplotlib colormap object (ie, matplotlib.cm.jet) or a string name of such\n",

    "- Add the keyword `allow_duplicates` to `DataFrame.insert` to allow a duplicate column\n",
    "  to be inserted if `True`, default is `False` (same as prior to 0.12) ([GH3679](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/3679))  \n",
    "- Implement `__nonzero__` for `NDFrame` objects ([GH3691](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/3691), [GH3696](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/3696))  \n",
