    "- `Series` has gained the properties `.is_monotonic`, `.is_monotonic_increasing`, `.is_monotonic_decreasing`, similar to `Index` ([GH13336](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/13336))  \n",

    "- `read_stata()` and `StataReader` raise with a more explicit error message when reading Stata files with repeated value labels when `convert_categoricals=True` ([GH13923](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/13923))  \n",

    "- `to_html()` now has a `border` argument to control the value in the opening `<table>` tag. The default is the value of the `html.border` option, which defaults to 1. This also affects the notebook HTML repr, but since Jupyter’s CSS includes a border-width attribute, the visual effect is the same. ([GH11563](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/11563)).  \n",
    "- Raise `ImportError` in the sql functions when `sqlalchemy` is not installed and a connection string is used ([GH11920](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/11920)).  \n",
    "- Compatibility with matplotlib 2.0. Older versions of pandas should also work with matplotlib 2.0 ([GH13333](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/13333))  \n",

    "- Non-convertible dates in an excel date column will be returned without conversion and the column will be `object` dtype, rather than raising an exception ([GH10001](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/10001)).  \n",
    "- `pd.Timedelta(None)` is now accepted and will return `NaT`, mirroring `pd.Timestamp` ([GH13687](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/13687))  \n",

    "- An `UnsupportedFunctionCall` error is now raised if NumPy ufuncs like `np.mean` are called on groupby or resample objects ([GH12811](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/12811)).  \n",
    "- `__setitem__` will no longer apply a callable rhs as a function instead of storing it. Call `where` directly to get the previous behavior ([GH13299](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/13299)).  \n",

    "- `Styler.apply` is now more strict about the outputs your function must return. For `axis=0` or `axis=1`, the output shape must be identical. For `axis=None`, the output must be a DataFrame with identical columns and index labels ([GH13222](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/13222)).  \n",
    "- `Float64Index.astype(int)` will now raise `ValueError` if `Float64Index` contains `NaN` values ([GH13149](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/13149))  \n",
    "- `TimedeltaIndex.astype(int)` and `DatetimeIndex.astype(int)` will now return `Int64Index` instead of `np.array` ([GH13209](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/13209))  \n",
    "- Passing `Period` with multiple frequencies to normal `Index` now returns `Index` with `object` dtype ([GH13664](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/13664))  \n",
    "- `PeriodIndex.fillna` with `Period` has different freq now coerces to `object` dtype ([GH13664](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/13664))  \n",
    "- Faceted boxplots from `DataFrame.boxplot(by=col)` now return a `Series` when `return_type` is not None. Previously these returned an `OrderedDict`. Note that when `return_type=None`, the default, these still return a 2-D NumPy array ([GH12216](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/12216), [GH7096](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/7096)).  \n",
    "- `pd.read_hdf` will now raise a `ValueError` instead of `KeyError`, if a mode other than `r`, `r+` and `a` is supplied. ([GH13623](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/13623))  \n",
    "- `pd.read_csv()`, `pd.read_table()`, and `pd.read_hdf()` raise the builtin `FileNotFoundError` exception for Python 3.x when called on a nonexistent file; this is back-ported as `IOError` in Python 2.x ([GH14086](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/14086))  \n",
    "- More informative exceptions are passed through the csv parser. The exception type would now be the original exception type instead of `CParserError` ([GH13652](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/13652)).  \n",
    "- `pd.read_csv()` in the C engine will now issue a `ParserWarning` or raise a `ValueError` when `sep` encoded is more than one character long ([GH14065](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/14065))  \n",
    "- `DataFrame.values` will now return `float64` with a `DataFrame` of mixed `int64` and `uint64` dtypes, conforming to `np.find_common_type` ([GH10364](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/10364), [GH13917](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/13917))  \n",
