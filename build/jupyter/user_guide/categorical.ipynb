    "\n",
    "Categoricals are a pandas data type corresponding to categorical variables in\n",

    "social class, blood type, country affiliation, observation time or rating via\n",
    "Likert scales.\n",

    "\n",
    "All values of categorical data are either in categories or np.nan. Order is defined by\n",

    "the categories array.\n",

    "The categorical data type is useful in the following cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A string variable consisting of only a few different values. Converting such a string\n",
    "  variable to a categorical variable will save some memory, see [here](#categorical-memory).  \n",
